## ⚠️ **RISK MITIGATION & CONTINGENCIES**

### **Week 1 Risks**
- **Risk**: AAA implementation complexity exceeds estimates
- **Mitigation**: Start with simpler augmentation techniques, add complexity gradually
- **Contingency**: Use traditional augmentation methods if Bayesian optimization fails

### **Week 2 Risks**  
- **Risk**: Adversarial training destabilizes model accuracy
- **Mitigation**: Gradual adversarial training with small perturbations initially
- **Contingency**: Focus on quantization-based robustness if adversarial training fails

### **Week 3 Risks**
- **Risk**: Enhanced training doesn't converge or accuracy decreases
- **Mitigation**: Careful hyperparameter tuning and learning rate scheduling
- **Contingency**: Revert to best individual technique if combination fails

### **Week 4 Risks**
- **Risk**: Model too large for nRF5340 after enhancements
- **Mitigation**: Progressive pruning and compression during testing
- **Contingency**: Simplified model architecture if size constraints can't be met
