# Supply Chain Intelligence Platform (SCIP)
## Military-Grade Electronics Component Sourcing AI

### Mission Statement
Build an enterprise-grade AI platform that ingests multi-source data (emails, Teams, ERPs, web intelligence) to provide superhuman insights for electronics component sourcing, supplier optimization, and geopolitical risk assessment.

### Core Objectives
1. **Data Integration**: Unify all company data sources into a single intelligence platform
2. **AI-Powered Analysis**: Deploy advanced ML models for pattern recognition beyond human capability
3. **Proactive Intelligence**: Generate actionable insights and recommendations automatically
4. **Global Intelligence**: Monitor internet-scale data for supply chain disruptions
5. **Palantir-Grade Security**: Implement defense-level data governance and access controls

### Key Capabilities
- Real-time Microsoft 365 (Outlook, Teams) data ingestion
- ERP integration (Visma, Microsoft Business Central)
- Internet-scale web crawling and intelligence gathering
- Advanced AI/ML pipeline for predictive analytics
- Geopolitical risk assessment and early warning system
- Automated supplier optimization and opportunity detection

### Success Metrics
